This repository contains an R script which downloads data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) regional datasets via API and saves them as csv.

It is using the package 'bea.R' and has been developed with the help of various materials such as the package description, templates found on GitHub etc.

I will add further sample scripts whenever I download more BEA data in the future.
